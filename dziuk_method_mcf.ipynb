    " # Dziuk's method for mean curvature flow\n",
    " In this tutorial we solve an example of a so-called *geometric evolution problem*.\n",
    " Such problems are characterized by the fact that we not only need to solve\n",
    " a PDE on a manifold, but that this PDE solution itself determines how the manifold\n",
    " is evolving over time.\n",
    " Here, we consider the prototype problems of all geometric evolution problems,\n",
    " the mean the so-called mean curvature flow. Roughly speaking, a time-dependent surface geometry  $\\Gamma_t$ follows the mean curvature flow, if\n",
    " the surface deforms in such way that the area integral\n",
    " $$ E(\\Gamma_t) = \\int_{\\Gamma_t} 1 \\;ds $$\n",
    " is minimized the fastest.\n",
    " Mean curvature flow is also an example of a curvature-driven interface evolution\n",
    " and such problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering and are used to\n",
    " describe problems such as\n",
    " - grain boundary motion in crystalline structures, e.g. snow flakes\n",
    " - phase separation problem (lava lamps, vinaigrette sauce)\n",
    " - tumor growth\n",
    " - shape optimization, e.g., optimization the shape of a wing to maximize drift/minimize drag)\n",
    " and many many more, see this [review article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s13291-013-0066-2),\n",
